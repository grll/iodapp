In that instance for the arxiv mcp server a storage path to a folder is required. Note that a default value is provided and works in most cases.

4. Finally click on the 'Auto-Install' button at the bottom of the form. This will trigger the iod application to install the MCP server for you in your Claude Desktop Application.

Once the server is installed by iod, the application should show a success notification. The Claude Desktop App will restart to complete the installation.
